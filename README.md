COMP 4905 Project
===============
Carcassonne
---------------
A networking game developed based on the Carcassonne board game. This project is for COMP4905 (Honours Project) which is supervised by Jean-Pierre Corriveau. The back-end implementation uses the Reactor and Connector-Acceptor pattern and using Google Protocol Buffer to serialize data. The front-end implementation uses JavaFX where the graphical interfaces are separated into .fxml files.

When running, a "Carcassonne Manager" is opened where the user has the option to host a game and/or join a game. The server will be for sending/broadcasting/receiving events between each player. The server will display log messages and the player information on a graphical user interface.
